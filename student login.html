          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 8</h5><p>Because although we exist only for our masters' pleasure, that existence is so much more pleasant when the man isn't a doddering, indolent gourmand.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>

          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 3</h5><p>Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere,</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 4</h5><p>when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 5</h5><p>admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity. “You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 6</h5><p>one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 7</h5><p>“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair. “I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 8</h5><p>You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness nil, has no real existence. They taught you that?</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 9</h5><p>Filby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 10</h5><p>“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,” continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>

          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 1</h5><p>Even past midday, Freyr didn’t have much bearing on the stone court. Lord’s Keep was too tall, and the red sun was not even at its zenith yet.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 2</h5><p>In its current position, the two sparring figures produced slender shadows dancing in rhythmic beats of one another. Hydro Paen’s younger brother, Aiton,</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 3</h5><p>looked on closely from the shaded portion of the castle walls. Aiton sat in a long chair, held tight by his mother. His mother’s friends were there too—marchionesses from</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 4</h5><p>different provinces of Acquava. Elias Ward, his father’s adored, had also taken a spot amongst the crowd, waiting to tend to any injury. Hydro tried not to focus on them,</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 5</h5><p>but every so often he caught himself stealing a gaze, watching for his mother’s eye, which never seemed to look. Mostly Hydro focused on the man in front of him: Korth.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 6</h5><p>His trainer swung his sword upward, forcing Hydro into a backflip. Upon landing, he ducked to avoid another stroke. Using his momentum, Hydro propelled his body forward,</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 7</h5><p>lance in front, attempting to pierce Korth’s seachrome armor. He missed. Back exposed, he tugged on the golden chain attached to his sapphire lance and spun around.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 8</h5><p>“Good reflexes, Prince,” said Korth. His thick moustache bobbed up and down beneath the gap of his seachrome helm. “I do not need your praise, Korth.”</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 9</h5><p>Hydro jabbed his lance forward, but it was batted away. A heavy boot struck his stomach, causing his chest to heave inward. Defeat rang thrice as the lance clattered on the court.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 10</h5><p>“You may not need my praise, but you certainly need my help. Your lance skills are still mediocre.” Korth grinned, extending his sea-leather glove, dotted in brine, downed.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
