          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 5</h5><p>He seemed to have calmed since I'd been presented to him. At least, rage no longer vibrated from his frame.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 6</h5><p>I was hopeful that he'd come to accept me—once he took the trouble to actually look at me. Eros, he was beautiful,</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>

          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 8</h5><p>Because although we exist only for our masters' pleasure, that existence is so much more pleasant when the man isn't a doddering, indolent gourmand.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 9</h5><p>This man was still young, forty years, give or take, the lines around his eyes still faint, the merest touch of gray at his temples.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>

          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 3</h5><p>combined chemically according to their affinities, formed themselves into molecules, and made those nebulous masses with which the depths of the heavens are strewed.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>

          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 8</h5><p>and gravitate round it under the form of innumerable stars. The nebulae, of which astronomers count nearly 5,000 at present, were formed.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 9</h5><p>Amongst these 5,000 nebulae there is one that men have called the Milky Way, and which contains eighteen millions of stars, each of which has become the centre of a solar.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>

          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 2</h5><p>“I was only saying hello to Stephen White.” I knew better than to talk back, but sometimes my mouth was faster than my brain. I’d become a fighter, that summer.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 3</h5><p>Mam smacked me. Hard. My head snapped back against the chair leg and for a moment I saw stars. “Don’t you be talkin’ to nobody!” Mam said. “I let you look out that window</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 4</h5><p>out a’ the kindness of my heart, but I’ll board it over if you go stickin’ your nose out, much less talkin’ to anyone!”.“Jamie’s out there,” I mumbled.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 5</h5><p>“And why shouldn’t he be?” Mam said. “He ain’t a cripple. Not like you. ”I clamped my lips over what I might have said next, and shook my head to clear it.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 6</h5><p>Then I saw the smear of blood on the floor. Oh, mercy. I hadn’t cleaned it all up from this afternoon. If Mam saw it, she’d put two and two together, fast.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 7</h5><p>Then I’d be in the soup for sure. I slid over until my bottom covered the bloodstain, and I curled my bad foot beneath me.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>

          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 9</h5><p>“Yes, Mam.” I pushed my window chair sideways to hide the blood. I crawled across the floor, keeping my scabbed-over bad foot out of Mam’s line of sight.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 10</h5><p>I pulled myself onto our second chair, lit the gas ring, and put the kettle on. “Cut me some bread and dripping, Mam said.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>

          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 1</h5><p>The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding a recondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 2</h5><p>face was flushed and animated. The fire burnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 3</h5><p>Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere,</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 4</h5><p>when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 5</h5><p>admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity. “You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 6</h5><p>one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 7</h5><p>“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair. “I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 8</h5><p>You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness nil, has no real existence. They taught you that?</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 9</h5><p>Filby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 10</h5><p>“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,” continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>

          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 2</h5><p>In its current position, the two sparring figures produced slender shadows dancing in rhythmic beats of one another. Hydro Paen’s younger brother, Aiton,</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 3</h5><p>looked on closely from the shaded portion of the castle walls. Aiton sat in a long chair, held tight by his mother. His mother’s friends were there too—marchionesses from</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 4</h5><p>different provinces of Acquava. Elias Ward, his father’s adored, had also taken a spot amongst the crowd, waiting to tend to any injury. Hydro tried not to focus on them,</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 5</h5><p>but every so often he caught himself stealing a gaze, watching for his mother’s eye, which never seemed to look. Mostly Hydro focused on the man in front of him: Korth.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 6</h5><p>His trainer swung his sword upward, forcing Hydro into a backflip. Upon landing, he ducked to avoid another stroke. Using his momentum, Hydro propelled his body forward,</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 7</h5><p>lance in front, attempting to pierce Korth’s seachrome armor. He missed. Back exposed, he tugged on the golden chain attached to his sapphire lance and spun around.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 8</h5><p>“Good reflexes, Prince,” said Korth. His thick moustache bobbed up and down beneath the gap of his seachrome helm. “I do not need your praise, Korth.”</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 9</h5><p>Hydro jabbed his lance forward, but it was batted away. A heavy boot struck his stomach, causing his chest to heave inward. Defeat rang thrice as the lance clattered on the court.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
          <div class="page"><div class="front"><h5>Page 10</h5><p>“You may not need my praise, but you certainly need my help. Your lance skills are still mediocre.” Korth grinned, extending his sea-leather glove, dotted in brine, downed.</p></div><div class="back"></div></div>
